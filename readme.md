ADX convertver + volume changer (Just a fancy batch script with some logging) by agilly1989

* Inspiration: A fellow called Kuiriel on discord
* Requires: no external libraries BUT needs
* -- ffmpeg.exe 3.2.2 (or similar version - supplied in release)
* -- radx_encode.exe and radx_decode.exe from https://github.com/Isaac-Lozano/radx (supplied in release)
* Written in Python 3.7.9 (but should be forward and back compatible with any Python 3.x)
* exe is made by pyinstaller and may false-positive your antivirus (I know it's triggered Windows Defender a few times)

Uses multithreading to use all it can to speed up everything, so the more cores, the *potentially* better

Usage:

Run it and it'll make "readme - part 2.md", open that as it has more instructions (made for your system)

Note: This is an ALPHA and "Dead" script. Due to my priorities changing all the time (and my motivation changing as often as the seconds hand moves) support for this script may not be available when you want it.
